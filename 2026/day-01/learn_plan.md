#Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud
Task
Today’s goal is to set the foundation for your DevOps journey.

You will create a 90-day personal DevOps learning plan that clearly defines:

What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
Where do you want to reach?
How you will stay consistent every single day?
This is not a generic plan.
This is your career execution blueprint for the next 90 days.

Expected Output
By the end of today, you should have:

A markdown file named:
learning-plan.md
or

A hand written plan for the next 90 Days (Recommended)
The file/note should clearly reflect your intent, discipline, and seriousness toward becoming a DevOps engineer.

Guidelines
Follow these rules while creating your plan:

Mention your current level - I am workign professional.

Define 3 clear goals for the next 90 days
    
Define 3 core DevOps skills you want to build
(example: Linux troubleshooting, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes debugging)
Allocate a weekly time budget
(example: 2–2.5 hours per day on weekdays, 4-6 hours weekends)
Keep the document under 1 page
Be honest and realistic; consistency matters more than perfection
